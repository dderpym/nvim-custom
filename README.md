# nvim-custom

my dotfiles for neovim

# how use

1. clone this directory into the config directory

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dderpym/nvim-custom ~/.config/nvim
```

2. open some files and stuff so the plugins do the thingy and install stuff

# what has

all the cool stuff from nvchad (https://nvchad.org)

ai integration with codeium so you can press tab for a living

all the cool stuff from lightspeed (https://github.com/ggandor/lightspeed.nvim)

a bunch of configured language servers (check out lspconfig.lua in the configs folder)

some formatting with null-ls (kind of fucks with conform, null-ls is carried over from my old config and it seems alright)

hex code color showing

folds with ufo

probably other cool stuff that i'm forgetting

# maybe big changes (soon)

might add vimspector for debugging capabilities

get rid of null-ls (we'll see if that's a good idea or not)

make better yup
