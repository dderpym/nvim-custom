# Now on LazyVim!

I've recently switched to LazyVim (okay, like a year ago) and I've been thinking about how to switch this over.

The old NvChad config is still available on the nvchad branch but will not be maintained (and honestly I'm not even sure if it still works).

I don't actually expect that anyone actually uses this config other than myself, but I can always pretend. Besides, if you're reading the README, clearly I'm wrong, right?

# Features
The new LazyVim config comes with all the nice things of LazyVim (automatic lsp support, treesitter, etc)
-animations (i kinda like it low key)\
-clangd as an lsp
-ability to run code through the editor via CRAG666/code_runner
-catppuccin color scheme
-competitest for running test cases (mostly aimed at competitive programming)
-leetcode integration to get those interviews
-images integration configured for ImageMagick and kitty terminal
-PlatformIO integration for embedded programming
-floating terminal (i mean it's like one line it's basically built into LazyVim but it's still mine)
